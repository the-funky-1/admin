./scripts/validate_structure.sh
```
✅ **Should pass** - validates file structure and tool registration

### 2. With Azure AD (Live Testing)
```bash
# Configure .env first
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with Azure AD credentials

# Start server
python -m m365_admin_mcp.server

# Should see:
# ✅ Graph API connection validated
# Server ready - listening on stdio
```

### 3. With Claude Code (End-to-End)
```
1. Configure Claude Code MCP settings (see QUICKSTART.md)
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Test commands:
   - "Create a new team named Test Team"
   - "List all teams in the organization"
   - "Create a channel named General in team [GUID]"
   - "Add user@example.com to team [GUID]"
   - "Provision a complete team with 3 channels"
```

## 📈 Performance Characteristics

### Tool Execution Times (Estimated)

| Tool | Cold Start | Warm Start | Network Calls | Rollback Support |
|------|-----------|------------|---------------|------------------|
| **create_team** | ~3s | ~2s | 1-2 Graph API calls | N/A |
| **list_teams** | ~2.5s | ~1.5s | 1-2 Graph API calls | N/A |
| **create_channel** | ~2s | ~1s | 1 Graph API call | Yes |
| **list_channels** | ~1.5s | ~0.8s | 1 Graph API call | N/A |
| **add_team_member** | ~2s | ~1.2s | 2 Graph API calls | Yes |
| **list_team_members** | ~1.5s | ~0.8s | 1 Graph API call | N/A |
| **provision_team** | ~10s | ~7s | 5-10 Graph API calls | Yes (automatic) |

**Notes**:
- Cold start includes Azure AD authentication
- Warm start reuses cached credentials
- provision_team time varies with channel and member count
- All operations are async
- Graph API throttling may affect timing
- Rollback executes in reverse order on failure

## 🎓 Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Orchestration with Rollback
- Context manager pattern for transaction safety
- Stack-based rollback execution (LIFO)
- Mark success explicitly to prevent unnecessary rollback
- Log all rollback actions for debugging

### 2. Microsoft Teams API Patterns
- Teams are built on top of Microsoft 365 Groups
- SharePoint site is automatically created with team
- Archive teams instead of deleting (Microsoft best practice)
- Team creation can take several seconds to fully provision

### 3. Member Management
- Must convert email to user ID via Graph API lookup
- Owners are members with special roles array
- AadUserConversationMember type for team members
- Filter users by userPrincipalName for email lookup

### 4. Channel Types
- Standard channels visible to all team members
- Private channels require explicit membership
- Channel membership type set at creation, cannot change
- General channel always exists and cannot be deleted

### 5. Error Handling Best Practices
- Try-catch at tool handler level with user-friendly messages
- Detailed logging with exc_info=True for debugging
- Orchestration failures trigger automatic rollback
- Email validation before Graph API calls prevents errors

## 📚 Next Steps

### Immediate (Recommended)
1. **Test in Claude Code** with real Azure AD tenant
2. **Create test team** to validate end-to-end flow
3. **Test orchestration** with provision_team tool
4. **Verify rollback** by forcing a failure scenario

### Short Term (Phase 4)
1. **Service configuration** tools (2-3 days)
2. **Message tracking** integration
3. **Outlook add-in deployment** automation
4. **Feature enablement** tools

### Medium Term (Future Phases)
